## Possibilities with Machine Learning & Data Science 

- Even though it's essential to know how the different models work, how to prepare and clean data and all the other fancy tech tools surrounding the data science space, what's even more rewarding is to think of the possibilities which these tools present. 

- What are some of the advanced ML usecases which nobody is even thinking of as of today. 

- What could be a good way to think of such possibilities. 

- Even for that, we may need a model which helps us to predict what the future may look like. 

- What ML teaches is that when you've a lot of data and you train your model on that, you come up with a trained model which is generalized enough to produce correct results on the unseen samples. 

- Let's think of how the world has changed in the past so we can extrapolate from there to predict the future ?? 

- Let's look at some of the booming companies of present moment: 

1. Zomato :: Technology with a usecase
2. Uber :: Technology with a usecase
3. Paytm :: Fintech 
4. Cred :: Tech ( Fintech ) 
5. Netflix
6. Amazon Prime
7. Hotstar
8. Github
9. GPay

- The interesting thing to note about the above companies is that they're not the direct application of Internet rather most of them are the direct outcome of some of the applications of Internet e.g. Cloud 

- Imagine what cloud has given them :: 
1. Cloud enabled them to go to the market 
2. Cloud enabled them to scale fast
3. Cloud enabled them to serve content with such high availability that they made the cable TV network / dish TV kind of obselete 

- What are the technologies which were very relevant but have become kinda obselete :: 

1. Cable TV Network / Dish TV 
2. Telephones 
3. Radio 
4. DVD writers / DVDs 
5. Job Fests ( a lot of hirings are happening online now a days )

- Notice that the use case which all of the above served has not gone away from human life: 
1. We still talk ( via whatsapp ) 
2. We still entertain ourselves ( via Netflix & others ) 
3. We still share data ( via many apps ) 
4. We still search for jobs ( via Linkedin ) 

- What this suggests is that the human tastes and habits have not changed much but the way we fulfill those tastes / habits have changed because of the following factors :: 
1. Access ( it's easier to build a robot today because you can order all the components via Amazon ) 
2. We don't need to wait for the cable guy because Netflix is accessible just that you've to provide your credit card 
3. If we've a strong enough desire to learn, we've internet full of good course to learn from, we're no more limited to limited supply of mentors 

- Given all of this, the question is :: 
1. What would be next in tech? 
2. Who'll be the winners of 2021-2030 
3. What are the things which we'll see in 2030 to be very common? 

- The new ideas will emerge from the most common problems of today :: 
1. Despite the fact that policy bazaar has the best policies to offer, do we trust the agent enough to tell us the best policy vs the agent trying to maximize the profit of the company? 
- Will there be a virtual health assistant to tell us which policy is the best for us 
- The health assistant who's aware of all our habits from eating to sleeping 
- The health assistant who's going to work for us and not for the profits of any organization 
- The health assistant who's trustworthy ?? 
- Will it be an application of ML ?? 

2. Will there be someone who can consult us with a police complaint /or may be visit the office so we don't have to visit them. 

3. Someone who can remind us of our expiring insurance policies ?? 

4. Will all of the above usecases be handled by the same or different virtual assistants ?? 

5. Will there be an interface which'll read the thoughts from our brain and present us with the best options for the situation ??? 

*** 

- Exploring a bit further :: 
1. Will the stretcher be smart enough to take the patient to a required place or to the best doctors 
2. Will it be smart enough to tell attendants on where to go for a medicine etc. 
3. Will the above be driven by AI / ML ??? 

*** 

- Will the difference in day/night be over at least from the perspective of ordering stuff 
- Will all the services be 24x7 
- Will calling a self driving ambulance be as easy as ordering food on zomato :: will it pick your location automatically and help to get your patient to hospital 

*** 

- Will schooling change to groups of a few people working together to build skills 


- The possibilities of AI are immense and what's been done already is just the surface being scratched. 

- Whatever we say about the next 10 years, the outcome will surprise us because our words will most probably not be able to define the extent to which we'll achieve.
