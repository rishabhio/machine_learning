## First contact with Keras :: 

Keras is an API written on top of Tensorflow which is an end to end machine learning platform. 

TF combines 4 key abilities :: 
1. Efficienty executing low level tensor operations on CPU, GPU or TPU,
2. Computing the gradient of arbitrary differential expressions 
3. Scaling computation to many devices, such as clusters of 100s of GPUs 
4. Exporting programs ("graphs") to external runtimes such as servers, browsers, mobile and embedded devices 

## Keras 
The core data structures of Keras are layers and models.
